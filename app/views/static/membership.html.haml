%h2 Membership

%h3 Join us!

%p
  We are looking for new members! Keep reading to learn more about becoming a member and joining our awesome feminist community workshop.

%p
  The main reason to become a member is to be able to visit the space without a host. Non-members are welcome in the space if they are accompanied by a key member, to come to an open house night, to take a class, or to attend an open event.

%h3 Membership qualifications

%p
  To keep the focus on a great space for women, all members must identify as women in a way that's significant to them, and be old enough to carry out any responsibilities. Guests of members may be any gender or age. We specifically encourage bringing (supervised) children to the space. New members join through a nomination and voting process (see below).

%h3 Membership benefits and responsibilities

%p
  Double Union is a great place to work on projects during the week, but not a good option for full-time coworking. Members are encouraged to use the space, but not for conference calls or team meetings.

%h4 Regular members

%p This is the membership type you want if you would just like to work on your projects and not have to run the space.

%ul
  %li After attending two members meetings, you'll get a key code that lets you use the space whenever the building is open (generally 7am-7pm, Monday-Friday)
  %li You'll also be able to use the space in evenings and weekends when a key member is present
  %li Store your projects in the space (within reason)
  %li Pay monthly membership dues (what you can afford – generally between $10 and $50/month)

%h4 Key members

%p Key members literally have keys to the space, but are also key to Double Union.

%p If you are a key member, you can:

%ul
  %li Get into the space any time (a key!)
  %li Bring guests to the space
  %li Shape the space’s direction and future

%p Key members also have responsibilities:

%ul
  %li Contribute to the upkeep of the space
  %li Volunteer for various tasks (e.g., yarn coordinator!)
  %li Help uphold the rules of the space
  %li Nominate and vote on new members
  %li Come to weekly meetings

%h3 Apply

%p
  New members join through a nomination and voting process. To apply for Double
  Union membership, start by authenticating with Github. If you don't have a
  Github account, you will be able to create one for free. (And don't worry if you have an empty or sparse GitHub account, it's just for authentication!)

%p
  Before you apply, though, please read through our #{ link_to "Base Assumptions", base_assumptions_path }. They are very important to us and we want all members to be comfortable with them.
