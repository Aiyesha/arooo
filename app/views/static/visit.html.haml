%h3 Location

%p We are located on Valencia Street between 14th Street and 15th Street, between Four Barrel Coffee and Zeitgeist.

%h3 Access

%p Other than during events open to the public, Double Union visitors must be the invited guest of a member. Please do not visit without the express invitation of a member. Please do not invite guests unless you are a member. Guests may be any gender or age.

%h3 Conduct while in the space

%p Double Union has a strict #{ link_to "anti-harassment policy", policies_path } which all visitors and members are expected to follow at all times. This policy is enforced by all Double Union members.

%h3 Open house

%p Open house events are open to the general public. Visitors do not need an invitation from a member to attend an open house, and may be any gender or age. We will announce when we start having open houses.

%h3 Accessibility

%p There is a small elevator to our floor. The elevator is operable by anyone during daytime hours, but in the evening after about 6:30pm it’s usually locked. We have keys to the elevator. If you need the elevator in the evening or early morning, you will need to know that someone stair-using is in the space to bring the elevator up and down and leave it parked properly. The elevator entrance is 27″ wide; the space inside is a bit wider and 53″ deep. Larger powerchairs or scooters may need the freight elevator.

%p Double Union is actively working to create a culture where we create and maintain accessible space. We will add more accessibility information as we go on, and would love feedback on how to improve.
