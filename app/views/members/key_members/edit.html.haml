%h1 Become a key member!

%p Keymembers can access Double Union 24/7, host events, and bring guests of any gender. Learn more in the #{ link_to "Members Handbook about key membership", "https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yYXAj8rzQMiYt2xFdzm2xEOe0LCHohWNrMWzad-4mtQ/edit#heading=h.lsg2zdao236h" }.
%p Before filling out this form, note that a requirement for keymembership is to have attended at least two events at DU (including at least one members meeting or orientation); if you haven't done that yet, do that first. :) When you submit this form, it'll email the membership coordinators to ask them to arrange a time with you to get you set up with access to the space (including a key code and smartlock access). You can also email them at membership@doubleunion.org to follow up.
