  We gladly welcome and support members who can't afford to pay membership dues! That's why any member can request a scholarship due to financial need at any time. There is no waiting period before you can apply for a scholarship or other restriction on when or how often you can ask for a scholarship.

  Your scholarship application will be reviewed by a member of the board of directors and either granted or turned down within 2 weeks. We won't ask for documentation or proof of financial need, and we won't share your scholarship application with anyone else. If you don't hear back about your application within 2 weeks, please email #{BOARD_EMAIL}.

    We do not grant scholarships for reasons other than financial need. Financial need is defined as: paying $10/month would interfere with the member's ability to pay for rent, food, medical care, transit, clothes, schooling, employment-related opportunities, and other important parts of life. Examples of people who would qualify: long-term unemployed or underemployed people, students of many types, people working jobs below the Bay Area median wage, people with significant medical bills relative to their income, struggling writers or artists, people working low-income jobs with non-profits, young people with little or no support from their parents, and retired people whose retirement income is relatively low. Very few people employed full-time in the tech industry in the Bay Area will qualify as being in financial need.

    In particular, if you are moving away or otherwise unable to visit DU in person for a while, and you want to continue being a member, and you can afford to pay membership dues, you must still pay membership dues.
