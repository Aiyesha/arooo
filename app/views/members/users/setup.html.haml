%h1 Double Union Account Setup

%h3 Please do ALL of these things:
%ol
  %li Tell us your Google email + dues amount
  %li Set up your dues via PayPal using the form on THIS page
  %li Join the members mailing list

%h3 Step one: email & dues pledge

%p
  We use Google docs and calendar to share information.
  Let us know what email address we should share those things with and
  how much you're able to contribute as dues ($10, $25, or $50 per month).

%p
  If you ever need to update your Google docs/calendar email address, please email
  #{mail_to "membership@doubleunion.org"} and we'll get those updated, too.

.form
  = form_for @user, url: members_user_setup_path(@user) do |f|
    .form-group
      = f.label "Google-friendly email"
      = f.text_field :email_for_google, size: 40
    .form-group
      = f.label "Dues pledge"
      = f.number_field :dues_pledge, min: "10", max: "50"
    .form-group
      = f.submit "Submit", class: "btn btn-primary"

%h3 Step two: set up monthly dues via PayPal
%b If your PayPal account has a name other than the one you joined Double Union with, please email the new members coordinators at #{ mail_to 'membership@doubleunion.org' } to let them know, so they can identify your dues payment as yours.

%p You can also email membership@doubleunion.org if you have any questions or concerns about dues!

%h3 Step three: sign up for the mailing list

%p
  We'll get you approved quickly, and then you can introduce yourself! This is our main method of communication, so it's important you're on it. We highly recommend using filters/labels in your mail client to keep your inbox from being overwhelmed.
