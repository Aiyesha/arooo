%h4 To be approved, an application needs:
%ul
  %li #{Application::MINIMUM_YES}+ yes votes
  %li 1+ sponsor(s)
  %li <2 no votes
  %li Have been submitted for at least 7 days

%p Clicking "Approve" makes the person a member, sends them an email notifying them, and moves them into the New Member page, where the new member coordinators help get them set up.

%p Clicking "Reject" marks the person's application as rejected, but doesn't do anything else. Rejection emails are still a manual process from the membership@ email address.
